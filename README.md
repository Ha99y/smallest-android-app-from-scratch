# Smallest 6KB Android App From Scratch

This is a code template for building the smallest app possible for Android. This is just a hello world project with only the minimum code required to run an app. It has only one activity and one layout. And the compatibility of app is API level 1 onwards. I made this template for educational purposes but if you want to build an app that is extremly small then build your app on top of this.

Here is the description of the code and how to use it in Android Studio: [Build the Smallest 6KB Android App From Scratch](https://www.innoventionist.com/build-the-smallest-6kb-android-app-from-scratch/)
